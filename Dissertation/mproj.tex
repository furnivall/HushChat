A few words

\chapter{Requirements and Analysis}\label{analysis}
here's some words to test

\chapter{Design and Implementation}\label{design}

\section{Tools Used}
There are two primary components to the overall system - one or more clients applications which communicate with a central server.

\subsection{Client}
The final client application was written entirely in Kotlin (v1.6.10) using the Android Studio IDE.

\subsubsection{Socket.io implementation}
The Socket.io developers provide a native Java implementation of Socket.io. Due to Java's seamless interoperability with Kotlin, this did not cause any implementation problems with the version implemented (2.0.0).
